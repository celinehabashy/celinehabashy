# Hi, I'm Celine ðŸ‘‹

I completed my undergrad in Biomedical Sciences at Queenâ€™s University and Iâ€™m now doing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science at UBC. Iâ€™m interested in using data to better understand health, people, and systems â€” and I'm currently focused on building skills in data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to connect or check out what Iâ€™ve been working on.
