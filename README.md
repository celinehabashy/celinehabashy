# Hi, I'm Celine 👋

I'm a biomedical sciences grad turned data science master's student at UBC. I’m interested in using data to better understand health, people, and systems — and I'm currently focused on building skills in data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

- Projects at the intersection of healthcare and data science  
- Exploring how to make complex data more intuitive through clean, thoughtful visualizations  
- Learning how to scale up analysis using cloud tools

## 🛠 Tools I Use Often

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, Altair, Jupyter)  
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2)  
- SQL, Git, and a growing understanding of Docker and cloud services  
- Markdown and LaTeX when I'm feeling fancy  

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- How to make models more interpretable (especially in healthcare contexts)  
- Best practices for working with real-world data  
- Ways to communicate technical work more clearly to broader audiences  

## 🏁 Outside of Work

Since moving to Vancouver, I’ve started getting into running (still working on enjoying hills). I also watch Formula 1 — mostly for the drama, strategy, and occasional crashes that don’t require debugging.
