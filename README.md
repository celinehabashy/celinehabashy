# Hi, I'm Celine ðŸ‘‹

I completed my undergrad in Biomedical Sciences at Queenâ€™s University and Iâ€™m now doing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science at UBC. Iâ€™m interested in using data to better understand health, people, and systems â€” and I'm currently focused on building skills in data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.

## What Iâ€™m Working On

- Projects at the intersection of healthcare and data science  
- Exploring how to make complex data more intuitive through clean, thoughtful visualizations  
- Learning how to scale up analysis using cloud tools

## Tools I Use Often

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, Altair, Jupyter)  
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2)  
- SQL, Git, and a growing understanding of Docker and cloud services  
- Markdown and LaTeX when I'm feeling fancy  

## Currently Learning

- How to make models more interpretable (especially in healthcare contexts)  
- Best practices for working with real-world data  
- Ways to communicate technical work more clearly to broader audiences  

## Outside of Work

Since moving to Vancouver,Iâ€™ve been getting into running (hills are a work in progress). I also love watching Formula 1 for the drama, strategy, and chaos â€” no debugging required.
